                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p class="author"> Founded in 2023 by Frank Onyema Orji</p>
                <p>
                    NatureBlog is a nonprofit, volunteer-run site dedicated to raising awareness of important.
                    NatureBlog was founded in 2023 with the mission of raising awareness of important wildlife and ocean
                    conservation issues. We are passionate about protecting our Earth's natural environments and the
                    incredible creatures that call them home. Through engaging blog posts, photography, and video, our
                    team of writers, naturalists and marine biologists hope to both educate readers and inspire
                    action.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our founding blogger, Frank Orji, has always had a deep love of nature since his childhood days
                    exploring the forests near his home. He is studying Software Engineering in college and spent a year
                    volunteering at an Africa wildlife preserve. It was there that he witnessed firsthand the threats
                    facing many wild species and habitats. He was struck by how interconnected our world is - how the
                    decline of one animal could impact entire ecosystems. Frank was also moved by the dedication of
                    rangers and conservationists working tirelessly to make a difference, often with scarce
                    resources.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When Frank returned home, he wanted to find a way to contribute to conservation efforts from
                    afar. Combining his writing skills with his passion for the natural world, he launched NatureBlog.
                    Here Frank shares stories from the field, highlights neglected or imperiled species, and reports
                    on the cutting-edge research and policies that could reshape our relationship with the planet. He
                    also profiles inspiring individuals making an impact through their conservation work.</p>
                <br>
                <p>NatureBlog also features the work of young emerging voices in conservation. Through our Campus
                    Correspondents program, we publish articles and reports from college students conducting field
                    research or environmental advocacy campaigns. We hope to nurture the next generation of conservation
                    leaders and give them an platform to raise awareness of their important work.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As an entirely nonprofit and volunteer-run site, our mission remains to utilize the power of
                    storytelling and digital media to foster greater understanding and action. All profits from
                    NatureBlog's sponsors and donors go directly towards supporting frontline environmental groups and
                    community-based conservation efforts in places like Africa, Southeast Asia and South America. We
                    also maintain a list of reputable organizations on our site where readers can donate or volunteer
                    their time if they feel inspired to support a particular cause or region after reading one of our
                    stories.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So whether you are an enthusiast wanting to deepen your knowledge or simply curious about our
                    fragile planet, we hope you will find something compelling here at NatureBlog. Our goal is to
                    astonish with imagery of threatened landscapes, educate on pressing issues, and ignite that flame of
                    care for nature - so together we can work to safeguard Earth's biodiversity for generations to
                    come.</p>
